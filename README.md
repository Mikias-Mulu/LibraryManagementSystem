Library Management System (LMS)

📚 Project Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is a console-based software application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a library's operations. This project serves as a foundational exercise in understanding and applying the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java.

Through this system, users can perform essential library tasks such as managing books, issuing and returning items, and maintaining accurate records of library assets.

This project marks the first Object-Oriented Programming project developed by Mikias Mulu, focusing on grasping OOP methodologies through practical implementation.

🎯 Objectives

To understand and apply OOP concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

To develop a real-world application that mimics the basic workflow of a library.

To enhance problem-solving and logical thinking through hands-on coding practice.

To build a foundation for more advanced software development projects.

🛠️ Key Functionalities

Book Management: Handling addition, search, and listing of books.

Book Issuance: Facilitating the process of issuing books to users.

Return Management: Managing the return process and updating records.

User Interaction: Simple and intuitive console-based interface for user interaction.

Data Handling: Managing and manipulating data through object-oriented approaches.

💡 Learning Outcomes

By working on this project, the following competencies were targeted:

Understanding class design and object creation.

Applying data encapsulation to protect and organize information.

Implementing methods to simulate real-life operations.

Structuring programs modularly for better maintainability.

Practicing user input handling and program control flow.

📈 Future Enhancements

While the current version of LMS is basic and console-based, potential improvements include:

Transitioning to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better user experience.

Implementing persistent data storage using databases.

Adding user authentication and role-based access controls.

Enhancing the system with report generation and analytics features.

Supporting multithreading for handling simultaneous user requests.
